# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the resale prices of Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) flats in Singapore. The dataset is provided by the Singapore government and includes various attributes related to resale transactions.
The dataset provides information on resale transacted prices of HDB flats. Prior to March 2012, the data is based on the date of approval for the resale transactions. From March 2012 onwards, the data is based on the date of registration for the resale transactions
